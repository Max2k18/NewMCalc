    <string name="release_note_2_8"><![CDATA[
Version 2.8.0<br>
<br>
<b>New:</b><br>
- Now trigonometric functions accept arguments in radians by default.<br>
Added the degree (&deg;) and gradian (&#7586;) operators to calculate the value from the angle in degrees or gradians.<br>
They can also be used to convert to radians (for example, 30&deg; = 0.526)<br>
- The design of the settings has been updated<br>
<b>Corrections:</b><br>
- Fixed a bug where the result of the premise was added to the history

Version 2.6.0<br>
<br>
<b>New:</b><br>
- The panel with functions and constants has been moved to the first panel in the scrollable list<br>
- Added cotangent, arcotangent, arcsine, arccosine, arctangent<br>
- Added gcd and lcm<br>
- Added the base of the root (√4(16) will show 2 means the square root of 16 base 4, but √4 or √(4) means the square root of 4 base 2) <br>
- Added lists (several independent expressions separated by semicolons, on which operations can be performed)<br>
You can read more about the lists at this <a href=\'https://github.com/MaxSavTeam/calculator-core/releases/tag/2.0.0\'>link</a><br>
<br>

    <string name="release_note_2_0"><![CDATA[We are introducing version 2.0.<br>It has a lot of changes both in the user interface and internal functional improvements.<br><br>From the interface changes:<br>- Mathematical operations (which were on the numbers) are moved to a separate panel, which can be opened by swiping to the left.<br>- Added a beautiful ripple when you click on the numbers and operations buttons.<br>- New notation of the Euler number.<br><br>From functional changes:<br>- Added the Fi number (1.618)<br>- Added an arbitrary base of the logarithm. For example, the expression "log2(64)" is equivalent to "logarithm 64 on base 2", and the expression "log 20" is equivalent to "logarithm 20 on base 10".<br>- Removed the geometric mean function due to uselessness.<br><br>The method of parsing and counting the expression has also been changed, which is more optimal from the point of view of work and from the point of view of maintenance by the developer.]]></string>
