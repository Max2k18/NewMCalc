# New MCalc
## A little about this repository
This is the repository of an application published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxsavteam.newmcalc).
I will try to add here a list of changes with each version. 
But I decided to conduct only from version 1.9.0, because I do not remember the changes of the previous ones. Sorry :)

I have some plans that can be added or changed in the application (see file Plans). You can help me :)

I translate text through Google Translator, because I do not know English so well (I'm from Belarus)
